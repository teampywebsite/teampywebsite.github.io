	<p>Our client is the <strong>Department of General Services</strong>. They were working on modernizing their time tracking system. 
		Their current system is not as up to date as they would like it to be. That is where our team comes in. 
		They assigned us the task of designing and implementing a new system. </p>

    <p>The purpose of our project is to reduce the amount time it takes for our client's employees to input their time. There is also a need
		for our time tracking system to be implement within their own current website.
	</p>
	
	<p>The business problem this project will address is the current amount of time the employees are spending on the current system.</p>

	<p>The main goal of this project is to provide a resource for both employees and supervisors to have a system in place within the current website.</p>

    <p>Our team will improve their tracking system by allowing it to be more efficient with inputting data and allowing all users
	to access the data tracking system as well as centralizing the process and output

			<li>Quick and easy for employees to input their task hours</li>
			<li>Prohibit staff the ability to edit previous times</li>
			<li>Any time modification can now only be done by supervisors</li>
			<li>New design will be implemented with using Microsoft .NET Core 3.1.1 and Angular 9.0</li>
